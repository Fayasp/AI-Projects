How it Works (Workflow)

User Input:
The user types a query, e.g., "Multiply 4 and 6".

ReAct Agent:

Receives the input and analyzes it.

Determines whether the input is simple conversation or requires a tool.

Tool Execution (if needed):

Calls the appropriate Python function (calculator or say_hello).

Function returns a result (e.g., "4 * 6 = 24").

Response Streaming:

The agent streams the response back to the console in real time.

Repeat:

Continues until the user types "quit".
