<!-- TenserflowTensorFlow is an open-source machine learning and deep learning framework created by Google.

It helps developers build, train, and deploy artificial intelligence (AI) models — such as image classifiers, chatbots, and predictive systems — with ease.



OpenCV stands for Open Source Computer Vision Library.
It’s a free, open-source library used for image processing, computer vision, and machine learning tasks.
so we can pass to tenserflow -->

MobileNetV2

This is a pre-trained neural network provided by TensorFlow / Keras.

All the model weights are already included (or downloaded from Keras when you first run it).

Everything runs locally on your machine, so no internet or API key is needed.
